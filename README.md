## Improvements/Considerations

To fully complete this project to production standards, the items that I would address are:

- Unit testing
- End 2 end testing
- Test cross browser/device & fix any issues
- Provide `<noscript>` content for browsers where JS is disabled
- Minify/Uglify the JS/CSS/HTML resources for smaller payload size
- Test app performance and make improvements where necessary
- Adjust/refactor code based on peer feedback
